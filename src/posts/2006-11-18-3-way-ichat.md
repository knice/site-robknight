![iChat with 3 people](/assets/images/2006/11/ichat.jpg)

The other night at work, I finally found myself surrounded by enough Macs to pull-off a video chat with two other participants. The feature has been part of OSX since 10.3 (Panther), but I've never known enough people with iSight cameras to do it. It requires a G5 or Intel processor to initiate a chat with multiple video feeds. Being on a Powerbook G4, I couldn't initiate the chat, only participate.

It was quite fun. Full disclosure: two of us were already sitting right across from each other! So, I wouldn't call it a test of the capability, just good old fashioned geek delight! Find a couple of friends with Macs and get the party started.
