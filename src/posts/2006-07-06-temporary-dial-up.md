For the next day or so, I have to get onto the information superhighway using the internet's Ford Festiva...dial-up. We just got our phone in a new house (longer post on that when it doesn't involve the phone and a busy signal) but don't have internet yet. So, I'm dialing in. It's like driving that Festiva in the "soft shoulder" of the internet.

S-L-O-W.

Hopefully not for too much longer. The world is not exactly your oyster when it comes to selecting ISPs, if you know what I mean? Lack of choice makes certain decisions in life quicker than others. I had 3 minus 2 choices and one is the slowest DSL. One company refused to offer DSL. AT&amp;T said they could do it as long as I paid what others pay for their fastest DSL service, except they weren't offering the fastest service. It was the slowest. Nice. So I have one actual choice. Fortunately, it's good quality service. Hoping they come through for me.
