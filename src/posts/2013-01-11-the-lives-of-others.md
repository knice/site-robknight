As I walked into the office this morning, I noticed a homeless guy hanging out over by Derby Park. The thought of him spending the night in the cold was unbearable to me. I was getting out of a warm car, headed for a (mostly) warm office, to spend the day with warm people. And here was this guy, sitting at a cold metal picnic table on a cold winter morning.

I went in and put my stuff down and decided to go buy him a cup of coffee.

He's younger than I am. Through our brief conversation, I learn that he's an alcoholic who has lived on the street for 7 years. He drinks a beer for breakfast and spends the day collecting recyclables to pay for food and his drinking habit.

That is his life. He is younger than I am.

Sometimes, I think we are afraid to get close to people like him because it reminds us how close we all are to that. Or so we can pretend _that_ part of society doesn't exist: the part that sleeps outside every night for 7 years.

I'm now in my warm office, drinking a warm cup of tea, talking to warm people. And he is outside, thinking about a beer, trying to make it all go away.

I think I'm being vague in this writing because I don't want to think about it. I just want to imagine it doesn't happen. I just want to pretend the worst of society is boring meetings and uncleaned lunch dishes in the office kitchen.

It's not. Be sympathetic to that. Always be sympathetic to that.
