While walking on Pacific Avenue in downtown Santa Cruz this evening, I strode past a pickup truck with a rickety dog sitting in the back. Standing next to the dog on the outside of the truck bed were three extras from _The Dukes of Hazzard_ movie. As I walked by, I managed to catch what was obviously the most important part of the conversation:

> I don't know guys...In _my_ experience, the hottest girls just kinda lay there and don't move.

I heard no more. But did I need to? That's right _not-so-hot_ girls, it has been confirmed. You are better in bed because you move. Score!
