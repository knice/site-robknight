From the [Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/) (01-07-2005):

> Privately, some Republicans are grumbling that Bush's approach [on Social Security] is the opposite of the successful way he operated in the campaign, because it has enabled opponents to define his position.

So, let me get this right. No wait, I'll figure it out. Hold on.

The way to be "successful" in a political campaign is to be so vague your opponent cannot even define your position?

I think Bush has always been pretty good at being vague, he started this discussion but says he has no plan out there yet and welcomes everyone to the table. Unless they're against his un-plan to start private accounts and phase-out Social Security. That's pretty clear, right?
