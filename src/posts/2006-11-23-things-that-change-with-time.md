I grew up during the mid-80's. That means that I lived through a very...interesting time of music in America. Although my dad generally played NPR on the radio in the car, when he didn't, we were treated to an 80's easy-listening experience that still resonates with me today. _Resonate_ here being used to describe a facial tick that develops whenever I hear [Sad&eacute;](http://www.google.com/musica?aid=0CeIIHzmzeB&sa=X&oi=music&ct=result).

At my gym however -- where there happens to be a large percentage of college kids born in the late 80's -- anything goes because they don't know how painful it was to experience some of that music firsthand.
So on a day when I choose not to bring my iPod to my workout (once a week, I opt for an organic workout free of any kind of technology), I am treated to a block of [_Wham!_](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wham!_(pop_duo)>) on the gym's speaker system.

When I was 10, George Michael was singing to _women_ in this song. Twenty years later, I can only chuckle when I hear it. Exactly _what_ hole did you find, George?
