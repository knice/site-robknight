![Mortified's Doomed Valentine's Show at The New Parish in Oakland, California](/assets/images/2020/2020-02-08-mortified.jpg)

- We went to Oakland to see the [Mortified _Doomed Valentine's_ show](http://getmortified.com) on Saturday evening. One of the speakers was a guy who made music videos when he was in high school. He even described the difficulty of syncing audio when editing with two [VCRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder) videos. I thought, "_Yes! Preach, brother!_" It might be time to dust off some videos from my own archive.
- I've been playing with a [looping pedal](https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-10r/) for the first time. I admire [musicians who are good at it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICrWn2ZpE3w) because it isn’t easy. It takes precise timing with your feet while playing.

- I'm still in search of a dining table and chairs to round out my downstairs living area. Having a nice place to sit and share a meal is my biggest goal—which is probably why it’s taken me so long to find the right set to add to the room. I'm looking forward to having people over more frequently and cooking for friends and family.
