![Me and my PlayDoh](/assets/images/2005/08/playdoh.jpg)

I don't have the PlayDoh press or French fry making kit. But the classic yellow container with "Doh" colored lid is real handy to have on my desk for moments of frustration or lost inspiration. How many times did you get it in your hair? In the carpet? Stuck to the cat? It brings back a long lost piece of childhood that few other things conjure.

Most importantly though, is the smell. The smell of PlayDoh hasn't changed in 20+ years. I love it. I can't even describe it. I don't want to try. It's just Playâ€¢Doh smell. If you think hard enough about it, you can probably smell it right now. Go get some. Put it on your desk. You'll thank me for it.
