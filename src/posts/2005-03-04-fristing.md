The definition of **Fristing**:

When Senate Majority Leader [Bill Frist (R-Tenn)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Frist) wakes up on Tuesday and says the following:

March 1, 2005, discussing Social Security Reform:

> "In terms of whether it will be a week, a month, six months, or a year, as to when we bring something to the floor, it's just too early,"

Frist then wakes up on Wednesday morning with Karl Rove's hand in an uncomfortable place, realizes his error in speaking and thus:

March 3, 2005:

> "We need to do it this year. Not the next year," Frist said Thursday on the Senate floor. "We are working towards this goal."

Now, use it in a sentence.
