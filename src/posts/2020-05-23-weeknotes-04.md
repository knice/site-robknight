- If you are prone to overestimate your ability to eat leafy greens, like I am, [the NY Times has you covered with storage tips](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/dining/storing-hearty-greens.html).
- I know the internet has plenty of anger and noise, but this is a big moment for science. Frontline medical staff, researchers, and public health professionals are on the job, and sharing their work. Bloomberg contributor Noah Smith collects and shares [interesting COVID-19 information on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion/status/1264056986460491778). I welcome the break from the usual conflict-driven news cycle.
- Speaking of Twitter, here are more smart people to follow on Twitter for _helpful_ thoughts on COVID-19 science (no surprise they are both mentioned in Noah Smith’s list):
  - [Bob Wachter from UCSF](https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1264027988795904000)
  - [Andy Slavitt](https://twitter.com/ASlavitt/status/1264230566154690560)
- [This episode of 20,000 Hertz about the sound design for Star Wars](https://www.20k.org/episodes/pewpew) is possibly my favorite episode of any podcast, ever. The sounds you know and love get deconstructed, **and** we get to learn their origin stories. My takeaway is that you can’t go wrong if you combine the sounds of an animal and a machine.
- 20K Hertz also did [a two-part series on Mel Blanc](https://www.20k.org/episodes/whatsupdoc), the creator of every memorable cartoon character of the mid-twentieth century. We all need this kind of nostalgia right now.
- In a Zoom happy hour earlier this week, we debated the must-see baseball movies of all time. Naturally we also searched for lists online. [MLB](https://www.mlb.com/news/best-baseball-movies-of-all-time-c301609142), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls064950205/), and [Rotten Tomatoes](https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/best-baseball-movies/) came through with good lists. I think the IMDB list lands closest to my feelings. The Rotten Tomatoes list has some intriguing films I’m looking forward to seeing.
