A few months ago, I started writing and drawing with my right hand. I'm naturally left-handed, so the result has been both child-like and comical. And the look of my right-handed penmanship has definitely influenced the subject matter of most of these drawings.

However, on the plane flight home from Seattle, I was thinking about more serious things and decided a right-handed drawing might be the best way to express some heavier thoughts.

Normally I post these on Facebook. But I think this one is better suited here, where things are more quiet. This isn't intended to start a religious debate. These are just my thoughts, poured out at 37,000 feet, through my right hand. Cheers.
