I grabbed a handful of Trader Joe's wasabi-coated peas (mistake number 1) and shoved them all into my mouth (mistake number 2). Apparently, the facial expressions created when one realizes 8 wasabi peas are on fire in one's sinuses are priceless. So, in the name of good comedy, the whole thing has been [captured on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FjmTNEtuYE "Wasabi-coated peas are a great snack! ") for instructional purposes.
