Most likely you never saw any of [these
photos](http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-60) from Iraq. They are
striking and demonstrate the disconnect between what we see in American
media coverage versus the reality on the ground. In no way do I mean to
politicize the American troops or Iraqi civilians in these photographs. I
just feel strongly that if American media had any intention of portraying
what it is truly like for U.S. troops and Iraqi citizens in Iraq, we would
have seen more of these award-winning photos before they won awards.
