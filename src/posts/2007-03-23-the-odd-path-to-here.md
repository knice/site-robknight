Chances are, you got here because you know me and you count on me to write a brand spanking new post on the night of every third blue moon. Or you came here because you were expecting a new addition to my [flickr collection of bad hair days](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rknight/sets/1032963/).

Tonight I looked a bit more into [Google's Webmaster Tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/) and discovered a tool to tell me what search queries returned a page from this site in the results. Not surprising, when you type "robknight" into Google and hit "I'm Feeling Lucky" you land here. I like to think I "[pwned](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn)" my name without spaces. All other robknights bow to me in cyberspace.

However, it can be quite interesting how others find your site. For instance, did you know you might get here if you did a Google search for **what will our children look like**? That would be because of [this post](http://robknight.net/2006/06/15/what-will-they-look-like/), which you will also see if you search **brow neanderthal slashdot** You may also end up here if you searched for **chase laguna beach** because of [my post](http://robknight.net/2006/09/05/im-famous/) on how I was compared to an ultra-mega-hottie from the <del>faux</del>reality MTV show. And in a sad, disappointing moment for my poor site, it turns out that only those searching for Laguna Beach's Chase [actually showed up here](http://robknight.net/images/query_clicks.jpg).

Oh, but it gets so much better. You may find me if you search **millertool** because [I once designated](http://robknight.net/2005/08/26/dennis-millertool/) Dennis Miller "Tool of the Month." Perhaps you were wondering about a career in cursing? So you headed to Google and [I showed up](http://robknight.net/2005/12/13/microsoft-can-do-good-things/).

However, the prize for the best search query that turns me up is **tang orange powder process**. Holy shit. I can't think of a better way to have people find my site than a post about [cleaning out your dishwasher with Tang](http://robknight.net/2006/11/16/alternative-uses-for-tang/).

You can see the rest of the list [here](http://robknight.net/images/queries.jpg).
