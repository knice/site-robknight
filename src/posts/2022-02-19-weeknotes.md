Week of 14 Feb 2022

This week I focused intently on web design. It’s always my job, but [we’re on a project](https://github.com/ucsc/theme-ucsc) right now that has me thinking about design all the time. I realized how much design thinking has changed on the web since I started my career in 2004. I love it. As someone who constantly thinks about how websites work, I enjoy taking a more disciplined approach to web design.

I also thought about changing our minds. The episode of Maintenance Phase I link to below was a reminder that people are flawed, and they bring their own biases to everything they do. We have the scientific method, peer-review, the first amendment, and other mechanisms to try and mitigate for our moral and cognitive failures. But there will always be people who test those mechanisms and even get through them.

I think about changing my mind all the time. _What am I missing?_ What information could come forward later that would force me to rethink my views on this? How would I handle significant data that flips my understanding of something upside down? All are important questions to ask yourself. And we will still make mistakes.

- The most important news of the week is that we all lost our collective shit on Tuesday when we [discovered the NYT version of Wordle had a different answer](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/15/22934587/wordle-solutions-changed-new-york-times) than the wild-type Wordle. _The horror_.
- On Vox Conversations, Sean Illing [spoke with the co-writer of Don’t Look Up, David Sirota](https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast/22922423/vox-conversations-dont-look-up-oscars-david-sirota) about the real themes and messages in the movie. It was--as many things are today--hopeful and disheartening. I particularly enjoyed their discussion about the movie showing the failure of our institutions--something I’ve thought about a lot lately.
- [What are your ‘fuck it this makes me happy’ non-frugal purchases?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/suqy2v/what_are_your_fuckit_this_makes_me_happy/) This Reddit thread was a joy to read. I love discussions like this. Expert opinions from people who carefully choose what they splurge.
- I haven’t read any of Johann Hari’s books, but his new one, Stolen Focus, sounds like something I’d enjoy. I listened to him talk about the epidemic of our shrinking attention spans on [Vox Conversations](https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast/2022/2/8/22910773/vox-conversations-johann-hari-stolen-focus) and [the Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-johann-hari.html). Both hosts pushed really hard on Hari to present practical solutions. I’m not what you’d call a lover of regulation, but it does seem we’ve reached a point in the Internet Age when it would be wise to have some of our in-person human rights extended to our devices and the companies that make them.
- [Maintenance Phase](https://www.maintenancephase.com/) is amazing. I will cherish this podcast for as long as Aubrey and Michael want to make it. [This week’s episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintenance-phase/id1535408667) was a thorough (and thoroughly enjoyable) take down of the movie ‘[Super-Size Me](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/)’. As someone who ingested (huh) all of the movie’s flawed logic and data, this episode put me in a very reflective mood.

Lastly, holy shit [this podcast series](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84) about a massive [MLM scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_marketing) disguised as a cryptocurrency investment is riveting. It’s also fascinating. To my earlier point about changing your mind, you can see from the folks in this series that MLM scammers exploit an existing flaw **we all have** in our thinking: once we are monetarily invested in something, we often become psychologically invested in it and our tribal instincts can be a very powerful force to overcome. I ran through the entire series in a couple of days and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’re at all interested in MLM scams, cryptocurrency, or human psychology, listen to this series.
