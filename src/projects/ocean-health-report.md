Working with the Communications & Marketing team at UC Santa Cruz, I designed and built this special report on ocean health. Released in the winter of 2016, this report synthesized the work of several UC Santa Cruz climate scientists and oceanographers to explain the unprecedented phenomena ocurring in the ocean just off our coast.
