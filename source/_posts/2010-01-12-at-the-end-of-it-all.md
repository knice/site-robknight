walk away.  
exit the building.  
turn the key.  
turn the radio up.  
this song is like a hug. i'll sing it until i'm hoarse.  
the ocean waves hello. and again. and again.  
it's so dark by the time i get here. but that won't last forever.

dinner is green and orange and dark green.  
colors that smell as good as they taste.  
mind is empty. ish.  
i wonder what i'll do before the end of it all?  
still a few hours to go.  
maybe less.

strum a bit.  
i'm glad my guitar is within reach,  
even if it still only knows those same 15 songs.  
at least a few of them are my own.

wash it all off, the day where little made sense.  
shampoo it out of my hair too.  
don't try too hard to make sense of it.  
remember the people, not the place.  
at the end of it all,  
just be able to sleep soundly,  
smile about it and leave it there.  
at the end of it all, is the beginning.
