My new year's resolution is to use my time more efficiently, and not to get distracted in my work. Apparently my resolutions aren't grandiose enough, others are aiming higher.
  
It seems like President _Chicken Little_'s new year's resolution is to **dismantle Social Security**. He's been parading the "crisis" rhetoric around for weeks. There's only one problem. Just like those sneaky weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (You remember [those](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3570845.stm), right?), there isn't a crisis.
