This is one of my all-time favorite [movie exchanges](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097351/quotes?qt=qt0314985). From _Field of Dreams_, Shoeless Joe Jackson coaches Archie Graham about what pitch to expect after the first two pitches barely miss his forehead.

* Shoeless Joe Jackson: The first two were high and tight, so where do you think the next one's gonna be?
* Archie Graham: Well, either low and away, or _in my ear_.
* Shoeless Joe Jackson: He's not gonna wanna load the bases, so look low and away.
* Archie Graham: Right.
* Shoeless Joe Jackson: But watch out for in your ear.

I love that he says "watch out" for in your ear. Don't look for it. Just react if need be. If you are on the lookout for the pitch that's headed for your skull, you'll never [hit the sweet pitch](http://t.co/klPEiUJ).
