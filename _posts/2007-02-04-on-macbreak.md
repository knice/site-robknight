During my day at Macworld in early January, I saw the crew from [Macbreak](http://twit.tv/mb) filming a couple of segments for their show. Little did I know, I was actually in one! I was of course, totally oblivious to the filming going on next to me as I meandered by and didn't actually notice the crew until I was past them. I had iPhone on the brain or something.

You can [watch the episode yourself](http://www.twit.tv/mb49) (.mov 88MB). I stroll by at 5 minutes and 33 seconds into the show and stroll out at 5 minutes and 35 seconds.

I should note, while I appear to be straining under the weight of Macworld schwag, there was no such bounty this year. I'm holding purchased items only. It was kind of...[a bummer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2-UuIEOcss).
