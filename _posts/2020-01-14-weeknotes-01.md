- [A fantastic podcast](https://overcast.fm/+CYHGAkoE) about the different ways we connect and how social media affects those interactions.
- [Another podcast](https://overcast.fm/+GH-uJyfQc) about the plethora of web tools a business uses and how hard they've become to manage. The discussion about intranets is relevant to me now as there are discussions about intranets on our campus. I'm ambivalent.
- I finished season one of The Leftovers and I'm _enthralled_. It feels like [Lost](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/), with fewer confusing storylines and a less expansive world to maintain. As with Lost, it does a good job of exposing human messiness.
- We walked the length of the [Devil's Slide trail in Pacifica](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/devil-s-slide). Go there at sunset. [It's beautiful](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7Nej_wgQBF/).
