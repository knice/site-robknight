Senator Majority Leader Bill Frist said "One way or another, the filibuster of judicial nominees must end."

This is absolutely preposterous and reckless when you consider the numbers:  

- 201 Bush-appointed judges have been confirmed.
- 10 have been filibustered.
- Clinton had 377 approved in 2 terms, averaging 189 per term.
- Bush's father had 193 during his only term.
  
So Bush Jr. gets more judges approved than either Clinton, or his father, and we need to **change the rules** of the senate?
