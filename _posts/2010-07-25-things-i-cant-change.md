I've been thinking about things I can't change. There are a lot of things I can't change. Too many to count. They're everywhere. All over.

Things I can't change come in the form of objects, sounds, people, places, and memories. There are others too. I figure I've only seen a fraction of the things I can't change. I bet there are a lot more to see. A lot of them are fun, exciting things. Probably a **ton** of them are.

Not all of the things I can't change are fun and exciting. Some are scary. Some are painful. Some make me feel sad. Some remind me of amazing times I've experienced in my life. Some don't.

There's one huge thing I can't change. I'll never, ever be able to change the past. I can't change my past. I can't change anyone else's past. The past is where it is. Back there, not here.

"Here" is where we all are. Here is where all of those things--the ones you can't change AND the ones you can--come together to make you and I who we are. We are the sum of our past. The things we all love about each other are _because_ of our past, not despite our past. As I stand "here," I can't change my past and neither can anyone else. But we can all change tomorrow. It's out there for the taking. It's waiting for us to tell it what to do...where we want to go...how we want to get there.

So the best thing I can do is focus on the things I _can_ change and not worry too much about the things I can't. That's likely the best balance: no balance. Focus on the things you can change and only consult the things you can't change when you need to. Don't let the things you can't change keep you up at night. Don't let them stop you from enjoying life. Don't let them stop you from reaching for what you want in life. Instead, look at the things you can change and store them in a glass that is half full.

And then inspire others to do the same.
