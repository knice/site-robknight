[![16 sunsets from highway 101, north of King City, Ca](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/5156782095_c895acbd51_b.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rknight/5156782095/)

Everyday  

We try to learn.  
We try to teach.  
We try to keep smiles within our reach.

We try to be stronger.  
Do things that scare us.  
Stand up tall when life dares us.

We laugh as much as we can.  
Sometimes, we cry.  
We try to be angels in our mother's eyes.

We try not to be hurt by what others might say.  
We share our love to keep our fears at bay.

We look for the moment-of-truth  
under the rocks we skipped over the previous day.

We look at the sky as we cover one eye  
and we see dragons and lion manes and far off places like  
forests where nature and magic play  
side by side, intertwined  
just like in our minds.

And then the sun sets  
and we try to get some rest  
and our heads keep spinning  
[playful, gentle spinning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP2Wlp4mabo).

We dream sweet dreams.

Because

We'll try everything again tomorrow.

And if the sun should not rise  
for all of us  
the next day  
we'll know we lived our fullest,  
shared our love with them,  
every moment of this day.

It can't be taken away.  
This day.  
And _every_ day we try.
