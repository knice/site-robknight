![Darcy and I]({{site.url}}/images/2011/05/me-and-darcy.jpg)

This is Darcy. She is a 6-year old Italian Greyhound. She is tiny, bony, and shy. She is also very sweet. Yesterday, we became friends. Apparently, Darcy doesn't make friends easy. So I feel pretty lucky that she decided I was friend material...and that my lap was a cozy place to hang out for awhile. Thanks Darcy. And thanks to Kev and Michelle for showing me around Walnut Creek.
